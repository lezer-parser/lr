// holding different pieces of information.
//
// When storing actions in 16-bit number arrays, they are split in the
// middle, with the first element holding the first 16 bits, and the
// second the rest.

// state 0, the start state), is often used to denote the absence of a
// valid action.

  // such a rule may start doesn't have the correct goto entries).

  // means that the current token must be shifted but the state should

  // determine which state to go to, the state already on the stack
